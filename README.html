README  (21 Jan 08)
--------------------

gunzip leptonlib-1.54.tar.gz
tar -xvf leptonlib-1.54.tar


1.  This tar includes library source, function prototypes,
    source for regression test and usage example programs,,
    and sample images for Linux on x86 (i386)
    and AMD 64 (x64), and on OSX (both powerPC and x86).
    It should compile properly with any version of gcc
    from 2.95.3 onward.

    Libraries, executables and prototypes are easily made,
    as described in 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

    When you extract from the archive, all files are put in a
    subdirectory 'leptonlib-1.54'.  In that directory you will
    find a src directory containing the source files for the library,
    and a prog directory containing source files for various
    testing and example programs.

2.  When you compile, object code is by default put into a tree
    whose root is also the parent of the src and prog directories.
    If you want to change the location of the generated object code,
    change the ROOT_DIR variable in the Makefile.  To make
    an optimized version of the library, along with the prototype
    extraction program, type:
          make
          make xtractprotos

3.  To compile and link with gcc on a little-endian machine,
    just run 'make' in the src and prog directories.
    It is also possible to make a debug version, as well as one that
    builds and uses shared libraries.  If you want to use shared
    libraries, you need to add the location of the shared
    libraries to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  See the Makefile for details.

    VERY IMPORTANT: the 100+ programs in the prog directory are
    an integral part of this package.  These can be divided into
    three types:
      (1) Programs that are complete regression tests.  The most
          important of these are named *_reg.
      (2) Programs that were used to test library functions or
          auto-gen library code.  These are useful for testing
          the behavior of small sets of functions, and for
          providing example code.
      (3) Programs that are useful applications in their own right.
          Examples of these are the PostScript conversion programs
          converttops, convertfilestops and printsplitimage.

4.  The prototype header file leptprotos.h (supplied) can be
    automatically generated using xtractprotos.  You first have to
    make this program:
         make xtractprotos
    which should be done after you first build the library.
    Then, to re-make leptprotos.h:
         make allprotos

    Things to note about xtractprotos, assuming that you are developing
    in leptonica and need to regenerate the prototype file leptprotos.h:
     - xtractprotos is part of leptonica; specifically, it is the only
       program you can make in the src directory (see the Makefile).
     - xtractprotos uses cpp, and older versions of cpp give useless warnings
       about the comment on line 23 of /usr/include/jmorecfg.h.  For
       that reason, a local version of jmorecfg.h is included that has
       the comment elided.
     - You can output the prototypes for any C file by running:
         xtractprotos <cfile>
     - The source for xtractprotos has been packaged up into a tar
       containing just the leptonica files necessary for building it
       in linux.  The tar file is available at:
         www.leptonica.com/source/xtractlib.tar.gz

5.  Pre-requisites for compilation and linking.
    The only dependencies required for using leptonlib are four
    libraries that are standard with all linux installations:
        libjpeg.a  (standard jfif jpeg library, version 62 (aka 6b))
        libpng.a   (standard png library, suggest version 1.2.8 or later)
	libz.a     (standard gzip library, suggest version 1.2.3)
	libtiff.a  (standard Leffler tiff library, version 3.7.2 or later;
                    current non-beta version is 3.8.2)
    These libraries (and their shared versions) should be in /usr/lib.
    (If they're not, you can change the LDFLAGS variable in the Makefile.)
    Additionally, for compilation, the following header files are
    assumed to be in /usr/include:
        jpeg:  jconfig.h
	png:   png.h, pngconf.h
	tiff:  tiff.h, tiffio.h
    What about jpeglib.h?  See item 19 below.

    These libraries are easy to obtain.  For example, using the
    debian package manager:
          sudo apt-get install <package>
    where <package> = {libpng12-dev, libjpeg62-dev, libtiff4-dev}.

    If for some reason you do not want to include some or all of the leptonlib
    I/O functions, stub files are included for the six different output
    formats (bmp, jpeg, png, pnm, ps and tiff).  Substitute the
    appropriate *iostub.c files for the *io.c files, and remove the
    corresponding header files from alltypes.h.  See src/Makefile.

    There is also a programmatic interface to gnuplot.  To use it, you
    need only the gnuplot executable (suggest version 3.7.2 or later);
    the gnuplot library is not required.

6.  If you want to compile the library and make programs on other platforms:
    (a) Apple PowerPC
	This is big-endian hardware.  All regression tests I have
	run for I/O and library components have passed on OS-X,
	but not every function has been tested, and it is possible
	that some may depend on byte ordering.  Please let me know
	if you find any problems.  This should compile properly, because
        it compiles and runs a little program (endiantest.c, courtesy of
        Bill Janssen) that sets $CPPFLAGS to define -DL_BIG_ENDIAN
        in both src/Makefile and prog/Makefile.
	For program development, 'make xtractprotos' in src to generate
	a mac-compatible version
    (b) Windows via mingw (cross-compilation)
        You can build a windows-compatible version of leptonlib from linux.
	Use Makefile.mingw and see the usage notes at the top of that file.
	You can then build executables in prog; see the notes in
	prog/Makefile.mingw.  I have not yet succeeded in making
	static executables this way, but others have.
    (c) Windows via cygwin
        A default download of cygwin, with full 'install' of the
	devel (for gnu make, gcc, etc) and graphics (for libjpeg,
	libtiff, libpng, libz) groups provides enough libraries and
	programs to compile the leptonlib libraries in src and make the .exe
	execuables in the prog directory.
        Make the following changes to the src/Makefile:
           (1) use the $CC with _CYGWIN_ENVIRON 
	   (2) for program development, where you want to automatically
	       extract protos with xtractprotos, add ".exe" appropriately
	Make the following changes to the prog/Makefile:
           (1) remove -fPIC from $CC
	   Note: I believe that convertfilestops, jbcorrelation,
                 jbrankhaus, maketile and viewertest will link.
    (d) Windows via MS VC++
        Older versions of VC++ do not conform to the 1999 C++ standard,
        which specifies stdint.h.  For these development environments,
        it is necessary to invoke compilation using the -DUSE_PSTDINT
        flag, which includes Paul Hsieh's pstdint.h, a portable
        version of stdint.h.  A copy is available here, and it can
        also be retrieved from
            http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/pstdint.h           

7.  Provides for your own memory management (allocator, deallocator).
    For pix, which tend to be large, the alloc/dealloc functions
    can be set programmatically.  For all other structs and arrays,
    the allocators are specified in environ.h.  Default functions
    are malloc and free.

8.  Unlike many other open source packages, Leptonica uses packed
    data for images with all bit/pixel (bpp) depths, allowing us
    to process pixels in parallel.  For example, rasterops works
    on all depths with 32-bit parallel operations throughout.
    Leptonica is also explicitly configured to work on both little-endian
    and big-endian hardware.  RGB image pixels are always stored
    in 32-bit words, and a few special functions are provided for
    scaling and rotation of RGB images that have been optimized by
    making explicit assumptions about the location of the R, G and B
    components in the 32-bit pixel.  In such cases, the restriction
    is documented in the function header.  The in-memory data structure
    used throughout Leptonica to hold the packed data is a Pix,
    which is defined and documented in pix.h.

9.  This is a source for a clean, fast implementation of rasterops.
    You can find details starting at the Leptonica home page,
    and also by looking directly at the source code.
    The low-level code is in roplow.c and ropiplow.c, and an
    interface is given in rop.c to the simple Pix image data structure.

10. This is a source for efficient implementations of binary and
    grayscale morphology.  You can find details starting at the
    Leptonica home page, and also by looking directly at the source code.

    Binary morphology is implemented two ways:

       (a) Successive full image rasterops for arbitrary 
           structuring elements (Sels)

       (b) Destination word accumulation (dwa) for specific Sels.
           This code is automatically generated.  See, for example,
           the code in fmorphgen.1.c and fmorphgenlow.1.c.
           These files were generated by running the program
           prog/fmorphautogen.c. Results can be checked by comparing dwa
	   and full image rasterops; e.g., prog/fmorphauto_reg.c.

    Method (b) is considerably faster than (a), which is the
    reason we've gone to the effort of supporting the use
    of this method for all Sels.  We also support two different
    boundary conditions for erosion.  

    Similarly, dwa code for the general hit-miss transform can
    be auto-generated from an array of hit-miss Sels.
    When prog/fhmtautogen.c is compiled and run, it generates
    the dwa C code in fhmtgen.1.c and fhmtgenlow.1.c.  These
    files can then be compiled into the libraries or into other programs.
    Results can be checked by comparing dwa and rasterop results;
    e.g., prog/fhmtauto_reg.c

    Several functions with simple parsers are provided to execute a
    sequence of morphological operations (plus binary rank reduction
    and replicative expansion).  See morphseq.c.

    The structuring element is represented by a simple Sel data structure
    defined in morph.h.  We provide (at least) seven ways to generate
    Sels in sel1.c, and several simple methods to generate hit-miss
    Sels for pattern finding in selgen.c.

    We also give a fast implementation of grayscale morphology for
    brick structuring elements (i.e., Sels that are separable
    into linear horizontal and vertical elements).  This uses
    the van Herk/Gil-Werman algorithm that performs the calculations
    in a time that is independent of the size of the Sels.
    Implementations of tophat and hdome are also given. 
    The low-level code is in graymorphlow.c.

    In use, the most common morphological Sels are separable bricks,
    of dimension n x m (where n or m is commonly 1).  Accordingly,
    we provide separable morphological operations on brick Sels,
    using for binary both rasterops and dwa, and for grayscale,
    the fast van Herk/Gil-Werman method.  Parsers are provided
    for a sequence of separable binary (rasterop and dwa) and grayscale
    brick morphological operations, in morphseq.c.  The main
    advantage in using the parsers is that you don't have to create
    and destroy Sels, or do any of the intermediate image bookkeeping.

    We also give composable separable brick functions for binary images,
    for both rasterop and dwa.  These decompose each of the linear
    operations into a sequence of two operations at different scales.
    As always, parsers are provided for a sequence of such operations.

    Finally, we provide grayscale rank order filters for brick filters.
    The rank order filter is a generalization of grayscale morphology
    to select the rank valued pixel (rather than the min or max).
    A color rank order filter applies the grayscale rank operation
    independently to each of the (r,g,b) components.

11. This is also a source for simple and relatively efficient
    implementations of image scaling, shear and rotation.

    There are many different scaling operations, some of which
    are listed here.  Grayscale and color image scaling are done
    by sampling, lowpass filtering followed by sampling,
    area mapping, and linear interpolation.
    Scaling operations with antialiased sampling, area mapping,
    and linear interpolation are limited to 2, 4 and 8 bpp gray,
    24 bpp full RGB color, and 2, 4 and 8 bpp colormapped
    (bpp == bits/pixel).  Scaling operations with simple sampling
    can be done at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 bpp.  Linear interpolation
    is slower but gives better results, especially for upsampling. 
    For moderate downsampling, best results are obtained with area
    mapping scaling.  With very high downsampling, either area mapping
    or antialias sampling (lowpass filter followed by sampling) give
    good results.  Fast area map with power-of-2 reduction are also
    provided.

    For fast analysis of grayscale and color images, it is useful to
    have integer subsampling combined with pixel depth reduction.
    RGB color images can thus be converted to low-resolution
    grayscale and binary images. 

    For binary scaling, the dest pixel can be selected from the
    closest corresponding source pixel.  For the special case of 
    power-of-2 binary reduction, low-pass rank-order filtering can be
    done in advance.  Isotropic integer expansion is done by pixel
    replication.

    We also provide 2x, 3x, 4x, 6x, 8x, and 16x scale-to-gray reduction
    on binary images, to produce high quality reduced grayscale images.
    These are integrated into a scale-to-gray function with arbitrary
    reduction.

    Conversely, we have special 2x and 4x scale-to-binary expansion
    on grayscale images, using linear interpolation on grayscale
    raster line buffers followed by either thresholding or dithering.  

    There are also some depth converters (without scaling), such
    as unpacking operations from 1 bpp to grayscale, and thresholding
    and dithering operations from grayscale to 1, 2 and 4 bpp.

    Image shear has no bpp constraints.  We provide horizontal
    and vertical shearing about an arbitrary point (really, a line),
    both in-place and from source to dest.

    There are two different types of general image rotators:

	a.  Grayscale rotation using area mapping
	    - pixRotateAM() for 8 bit gray and 24 bit color, about center
	    - pixRotateAMCorner() for 8 bit gray, about image UL corner
	    - pixRotateAMColorFast() for faster 24 bit color, about center

	b.  Rotation of an image of arbitrary bit depth, using
	    either 2 or 3 shears.  These rotations can be done
	    about an arbitrary point, and they can be either 
	    from source to dest or in-place; e.g.
	    - pixRotateShear()
	    - pixRotateShearIP()

	The area mapping rotations are slower and more accurate,
	because each new pixel is composed using an average of four
	neighboring pixels in the original image; this is sometimes
	also called "antialiasing".  Very fast color area mapping
	rotation is provided.  The low-level code is in rotateamlow.c.

	The shear rotations are much faster, and work on images
	of arbitrary pixel depth, but they just move pixels
	around without doing any averaging.  The pixRotateShearIP()
	operates on the image in-place.

    We also provide orthogonal rotators (90, 180, 270 degree; left-right
    flip and top-bottom flip) for arbitrary image depth.
    And we provide implementations of affine, projective and bilinear
    transforms, with both sampling (for speed) and interpolation
    (for antialiasing).

12. We provide a number of sequential algorithms, including 
    binary and grayscale seedfill, and the distance function for
    a binary image.  The most efficient binary seedfill is
    pixSeedfill(), which uses Vincent's algorithm to iterate
    raster- and antiraster-ordered propagation, and can be used
    for either 4- or 8-connected fills.  Similar raster/antiraster
    sequential algorithms are used to generate a distance map from
    a binary image, and for grayscale seedfill.  We also use Heckbert's 
    stack-based filling algorithm for identifying 4- and 8-connected
    components in a binary image.

13. A few simple image enhancement routines for grayscale and
    color images have been provided.  These include intensity mapping
    with gamma correction and contrast enhancement, as well as edge
    sharpening, smoothing, and hue and saturation modification.

14. A number of standard image processing operations are also
    included, such as block convolution, binary block rank filtering,
    grayscale and rgb rank order filtering, and edge and local
    minimum/maximum extraction. 

15. Some functions have been included specifically to help with
    document image analysis.  These include skew and text orientation
    detection, page segmentation, baseline finding for text,
    and unsupervised classification of connected components,
    characters and words.

16. Some facilities have been provided for image input and output.
    This is of course required to build executables that handle images,
    and many examples of such programs, most of which are for
    testing, can be built in the prog directory.  Functions have been
    provided to allow reading and writing of files in BMP, JPEG, PNG,
    TIFF, PNM and GIF formats.  The first five formats were chosen for the
    following reasons:

        - BMP has (until recently) had no compression.  It is a simple
	  format with colormaps that requires no external libraries.
	  It is commonly used because it is a Microsoft standard,
	  but has little else to recommend it.  See bmpio.c.

	- JFIF JPEG is the standard method for lossy compression
	  of grayscale and color images.  It is supported natively
	  in all browsers, and uses a good open source compression
	  library.  Decompression is supported by the rasterizers
	  in PS and PDF, for level 2 and above.  It has a progressive
	  mode that compresses about 10% better than standard, but
	  is considerably slower to decompress.  See jpegio.c.

	- PNG is the standard method for lossless compression
	  of binary, grayscale and color images.  It is supported
	  natively in all browsers, and uses a good open source
	  compression library (zlib).  It is superior in almost every
	  respect to GIF (which, until recently, contained proprietary
	  LZW compression).  See pngio.c.

	- TIFF is a common interchange format, which supports different
	  depths, colormaps, etc., and also has a relatively good and
	  widely used binary compression format (CCITT Group 4).  
	  Decompression of G4 is supported by rasterizers in PS and PDF,
	  level 2 and above.  G4 compresses better than PNG for most
	  text and line art images, but it does quite poorly for halftones.
	  It has good and stable support by Leffler's open source library,
	  which is clean and small.  Tiff also supports multipage
	  images through a directory structure.  See tiffio.c

	- PNM is a very simple, old format that still has surprisingly
	  wide use in the image processing community.  It does not
	  support compression or colormaps, but it does support binary,
	  grayscale and rgb images.  Like BMP, the implementation
	  is simple and requires no external libraries.  See pnmio.c.

    The GIF format has been added to support applications that need it.
    By default, gifiostub.c is in the Makefile, because we don't want
    to require users of the library to install giflib.  To read/write gif,
    replace gifiostub.c with gifio.c in the list of src files.  (See
    src/Makefile).
    
    Here's a summary:
        - All formats except JPEG support 1 bpp binary.
	- All formats support 8 bpp grayscale (GIF must have a colormap).
	- All formats except GIF support 24 bpp rgb color.
	- All formats except PNM support 8 bpp palette. 
	- PNG and PNM support 2 and 4 bpp images.
	- PNG supports 2 and 4 bpp palette, and 16 bpp without palette.
	- PNG, JPEG, TIFF and GIF support image compression; PNM and BMP do not.
    Use prog/ioformats_reg for a regression test.

    We also provide wrappers for PS output, from the following
    sources: binary Pix, 8 bpp gray Pix, 24 bpp full color Pix, 
    JFIF JPEG file and TIFF G4 file, all with a variety of options
    for scaling and placing the image, and for printing it at
    different resolutions.  See psio.c for examples of how to output
    PS for different applications.  As examples of usage, see:
       * prog/converttops.c for a general image --> PS conversion for printing
       * prog/convertfilestops.c to generate a multipage level 2 compressed
             PS file that can then be converted to pdf with ps2pdf.

    Note: any or all of these I/O library calls can be stubbed out.
    Details in (5) above, and in src/Makefile.

    For all formatted reads, and all formatted writes except to GIF,
    we support read from memory and write to memory.  For all but
    TIFF, these are supported through open_memstream() and fmemopen(),
    which are not available on windows.

    We also provide colormap removal for conversion to 8 bpp gray or
    for conversion to 24 bpp full color, as well as conversion
    from RGB to 8 bpp grayscale.  We also provide the inverse
    function to colormap removal; namely, color quantization
    from 24 bpp full color to 8 bpp palette with some number
    of palette colors.  Several versions are provided, that all
    use a fast octree vector quantizer.  For a high-level interfaces,
    see pixConvertRGBToColormap(), pixColorQuant1Pass(),
    pixOctreeColorQuant() and pixOctreeQuant().

    For debugging, several pixDisplay* functions are given.  Two can be
    called to display an image programmatically on an X display using xv.
    If necessary to fit on the screen, the image is reduced using
    scale-to-gray for readability (this is much better than letting
    xv do the reduction).  Another function, pixDisplayWrite(), writes
    images to disk under control of a debug flag, which then allows
    either viewing with gthumb or the generation of a composite image using
    pixaDisplayTiledAndScaled().  These files can also be gathered up
    into a compressed PostScript file, using prog/convertfilestops,
    and viewed with evince, or converted to pdf.  Common image display
    programs are: xv, display, gthumb, gqview, evince, gv, xpdf and acroread.
    The leptonica program xvdisp generates nice quality images for
    display with xv.

17. Simple data structures are provided for safe and
    efficient handling of arrays of numbers, strings, pointers,
    and bytes.  The pointer array is implemented in three ways:
    as a stack, a queue, and a heap (used to implement a priority
    queue).  The byte array is implemented as a queue.  The string
    arrays are particularly useful for both parsing and composing text.
    Generic lists with doubly-linked cons cells are also provided.

18. Examples of programs that are easily built using the library:

     - for plotting x-y data, we give a programmatic interface
       to the gnuplot program, with output to X11, png, ps or eps.
       We also allow serialization of the plot data, in a form
       such that the data can be read, the commands generated,
       and (finally) the plot constructed by running gnuplot.

     - a simple jbig2-type classifier, using various distance
       metrics between image components (correlation, rank
       hausdorff); see prog/jbcorrelation.c, prog/jbrankhaus.c.

     - a simple color segmenter, giving a smoothed image
       with a small number of the most significant colors.

     - a program for converting all tiff images in a directory
       to a PostScript file, and a program for printing an image
       in any (supported) format to a PostScript printer.

     - converters between binary images and SVG format.

     - a bitmap font facility that allows painting text onto
       images.  We currently support one font in several sizes.
       The font images and postscript programs for generating
       them are stored in prog/fonts/.

     - a binary maze game lets you generate mazes and find shortest
       paths between two arbitrary points, if such a path exists.
       You can also compute the "shortest" (i.e., least cost) path
       between points on a grayscale image.

     - see (15) for other document image applications.

19. A deficiency of C is that no standard has been universally
    adopted for typedefs of the built-in types.  As a result,
    typedef conflicts are common, and cause no end of havoc when
    you try to link different libraries.  If you're lucky, you
    can find an order in which the libraries can be linked
    to avoid these conflicts, but the state of affairs is aggravating.

    The most common typedefs use lower case variables: uint8, int8, ...
    The png library avoids typedef conflicts by altruistically
    appending "png_" to the type names.  Following that approach,
    Leptonica appends "l_" to the type name.  This should avoid
    just about all conflicts.  In the highly unlikely event that it doesn't,
    here's a simple way to change the type declarations throughout
    the Leptonica code:
     (1) customize a file "converttypes.sed" with the following lines:
         /l_uint8/s//YOUR_UINT8_NAME/g
         /l_int8/s//YOUR_INT8_NAME/g
         /l_uint16/s//YOUR_UINT16_NAME/g
         /l_int16/s//YOUR_INT16_NAME/g
         /l_uint32/s//YOUR_UINT32_NAME/g
         /l_int32/s//YOUR_INT32_NAME/g
         /l_float32/s//YOUR_FLOAT32_NAME/g
         /l_float64/s//YOUR_FLOAT64_NAME/g
     (2) in the src and prog directories:
        - if you have a version of sed that does in-place conversion:
             sed -i -f converttypes.sed *
        - else, do something like (in csh)
	     foreach file (*)
	     sed -f converttypes.sed $file > tempdir/$file
	     end

    If you are using Leptonica with a large code base that typedefs the
    built-in types differently from Leptonica, just edit the typedefs
    in environ.h.  This should have no side-effects with other libraries,
    and no issues should arise with the inclusion order of the Leptonica
    libraries for the linker.

    For compatibility with 64 bit hardware and compilers, where
    necessary we use the typedefs in stdint.h to specify the pointer
    size (either 4 or 8 byte).  This may not work properly if you use
    an ancient compiler before gcc 2.95.3.
	 
20. For C++ compatibility, we have included a local version of
    jpeglib.h (version 6b), with the 'extern "C"' macro added.
    The -I./ flag includes this local file, rather than the one
    in /usr/include, because of the order of include directories
    on the compile line.  jpeglib.h will by default include the
    locally-supplied version of jmorecfg.h.

21. Leptonica provides some compile-time control over messages
    and debug output.  Messages are of three types: error,
    warning and informational.  They are all macros, and
    are suppressed when NO_CONSOLE_IO is defined on the compile line.
    Likewise, all debug output is conditionally compiled, within
    a #ifndef NO_CONSOLE_IO clause, so these sections are
    omitted when NO_CONSOLE_IO is defined.   For production code
    where no output is to go to stderr, compile with -DNO_CONSOLE_IO.

22. If you use Leptonica with other systems, you have three
    choices with respect to the Pix data structure.  It is
    easiest if you can use the Pix directly.  Next easiest is to
    make a Pix from a local image data structure or the unbundled
    image parameters; see the file pix.h for the constraints on the
    image data that will permit you to avoid data replication.
    By far, the most work is to provide new high-level shims from some
    other image data structure to the low-level functions in the library,
    which take only built-in C data types.  It would be an inordinately
    large task to do this for the entire library.

23. New versions of the Leptonica library are released approximately
    monthly, and version numbers are provided for each release.
    A brief version chronology is maintained in version-notes.html.
    The library compiles without warnings with either g++ or gcc,
    but you will get warnings with the -Wall flag.
